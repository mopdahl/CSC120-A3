The TAs helped me compare a String[] and an ArrayList, so that I could comfortably use an ArrayList to store the conversation's transcript.

Initial Impressions / Comparing Java & Python:
Java and python appear very similar; however, Java seems to require more structure. Since an object's type is always specified, and since functions are tied to classes, it seems likely to be harder to make generic functions in Java. Planning ahead also seems more essential in Java than Python, for the same reasons.
Other than this, the languages seem similar. They use similar data types and methods, and logical structures are nearly identical. While I don't want to make a sweeping generalization based on only two languages, these traits may be common to most (high-level) programming languages. This might be likely, considering programming languages are built on logic and common need.

Experience / Advice:
Regular expressions were incredibly useful in this assignment! Using the regex.replaceAll() method was much more organized than my earlier attempts with Spring.split().
I also found that ArrayList worked better than a String[] for the transcript. The String[] needed to know its capacity when it was defined in the constructor, which would require getting user input each time a Conversation is created.

For future students: Look at the java documentation! Even looking at the available methods can help give you ideas for how to solve a problem.
